Do not share the below poem in public, but only under hush words, for they are cursed.
===================================================
When man was tossed from the skies for trying to steal it, his skin, shadow, and mind had left him.
His material goods would be turned to dust.
Man was returned to land, in bliss, while his skin attempted to steal the skies once again.
